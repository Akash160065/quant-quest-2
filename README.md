#1. Installation
### Python 2.7
You need Python 2.7 (Python 3 will be supported later) to run this toolbox. There are several distributions of Python 2.7 that can be used. For an easy installation process, we recommend Anaconda since it will reliably install all the necessary dependencies. Download [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) and follow the instructions on the [installation page](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install). Once you have Python, you can then install the toolbox.

### Quant Quest Toolbox
There are multiple ways to install the toolbox for the competition.

The easiest way and the most recommended way is via pip. Just run the following command:
`pip install -U auquan_toolbox`
 After that follow the templates provided in [Problem1.py] (https://github.com/Auquan/quant-quest-2/blob/master/problem1.py). If we publish any updates to the toolbox, the same command `pip install -U auquan_toolbox` will also automatically get the new version of the toolbox.
